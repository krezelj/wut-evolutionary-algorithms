# Introduction to Evolutionary Algorithms Project

This project was developed as a part of the Introduction to Evolutionary Algorithms course
at Warsaw University of Technology.

The aim of this project is to use evolutionary algorithms to obtain an agent able to solve
one of the OpenAI classic control problems. Apart from EA two other approaches are considered.

- ea: evolutionary algorithm
- rl: reinforcement learning
- sa: simulated annealing
